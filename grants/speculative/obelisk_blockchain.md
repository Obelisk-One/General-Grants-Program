## Project Description

SNP is a mobile enhanced wallet on Polkadot. It is intended to make it easy for Polkadot users to participate in Polkadot governance and pledge mining, and to build social networks that operate based upon identities. In the meantime, SNP will integrate Obelisk, an extended DAO protocol based on substrate development, which can support the communalization of Polkadot parachains projects, making governance and incentives among members as simple as using Internet products. We have released a simple version of the white paper and have completed the development of the minimum viable version of the SNP client. You can find more information here.	We aim to facilitate the governance on the chain, while establishing an orderly and sustainable organizational development model based on reputation and identity over the course of DAO, and ultimately realizing the user-controlled Internet.	With this grant, we shall continue to develop and optimize the SNP Wallet and Obelisk protocol.

### Why our Team choose SNP/Obelisk projects

Our team is proficient in Internet products, organizational mechanism design and block chain development. We are clear about what needs to be done for blockchain to be gladly accepted by common users, and we are keen to achieve the goals of Web3.0. In our opinion, in addition to vote on the chain as a final confirmation, DAO network based upon the membership identity shall be a powerful supplement of distributed community governance in the chain of a distributed system and some of the more adaptive work will be done in the form of DAO in the near future. Meanwhile, a specially designed social networking application for distributed communities shall better coordinate all members to reach a consensus, pooling the best talents and  ideas in the communities.
